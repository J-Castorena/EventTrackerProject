# EventTrackerProject


### Description
This is part of a multi-step project. This first week we are using a RESTful API and making sure CRUD operations are persisting to data base. The project continues to evolve. For the second part of the project, we added full CRUD functionality using JavaScript to build our HTML elements dynamically.The application also presents aggregated data.
We will implement a front end in the step to follow. 

The WOD Tracker application allows users to obtain a work out of the day. The user will be able to select a new work out routine each day. The application will provide the user with a work out regimen. With this application the user can enter the time it took to complete the work out this will allow the application to keep track on the users personal data. The application will also provide a commenting slot for the user to add any comments they would like.
